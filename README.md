#### Note from Auhtor

**Mopublish** is a Content Management System inspired by Drupal & Wordpress, so we have tried our best to match it's features and usubility to those php based CMS as much as possible.
We will always keep up the work to add more advanced features to enrich the product. Hope you will like it!!!
